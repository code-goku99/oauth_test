Logout functionality
====================
Doing logout of our app and also from the AuthServer(facebook) 
When we logout form our application to make logout from facebook the following approach is done

Concept : OIDC End session Endpoint
This will help us for single logout functionality where we can logout from both ClientApp and Auth Server when we logout from Cleint App.

Authorization service providers who support open id connect also support open id session management functionality and also provide special webservice endpoint.
That allows the client Application to logout the user session. When user clicks on logout of the application.It will redirect to session endpoint url which is exposed by Authorization server
and once the session of the Auth server is completed. then it will redirect to the url we provide.

Sample url would be as 
GET
/logout?id_token_hint={id-token-value}&post_logout_redirect_url={our redirect url}
here id_token_hint => is managed by spring framework by checking from Authentication object and append the id token to the url and we have to configure the redirect url 

Every Authorization server which support openid connect will expose the url
	https://{base-server-url}/.well-known/openid-configuration
	
	for keycloak server we have as
	http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/{our-realm-name}/.well-known/openid-configuration
	http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/oauthApp/.well-known/openid-configuration
